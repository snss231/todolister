# Todolister 

Get organised with this full-stack task management app! This was a little toy project I did over winter break to get my feet wet with Web development. You can try a demo here at https://todolist-er.herokuapp.com/

Create todolists, add tasks to them. Refer back anytime and mark the tasks as completed when you're done. Filter through your tasks with the search box. It's as intuitive as it gets!

This app was made with React, with a Ruby on Rails backend. Material UI components are used in the frontend.

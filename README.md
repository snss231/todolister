# Todolister 

Get organised with this full-stack task management app! This was a little toy project I did over winter break to get my feet wet with Web development. You can try a demo here at https://todolist-er.herokuapp.com/

Create todolists, add tasks to them. Refer back anytime and mark the tasks as completed when you're done. It's as intuitive as it gets!

## Technical details for developers
This app was made with React, with a Ruby on Rails backend. Material UI components were used in the frontend.
